Ed: Hello and welcome to Health EdVisor. My name is Ed and I will be walking you through your medication today. I will be giving you a lot of important information, so I want to make sure you understand. Iâ€™ll be asking some questions as we go, just to make sure I am doing a good job of explaining how to take your medication.
Ed: Your medication is called Metformin.
Ed: It is used to treat type 2 diabetes by helping to control the amount of sugar in your blood.
Ed: Take one tablet of Metformin by mouth.
Ed: Take your medicine two times a day, with breakfast and with dinner. Swallow the table whole.
Ed: That brings us to the end of our session. Thank you for your participation!
